    <h1>Hi</h1>

    <p>This is a private area of my website. I'm not sure what you're doing here, but unless you've managed
    to compromise my JWT authentication secrets, you're unlikely to find it useful. And even if you have,
    all you can do with the API here is make music play on the Echo in my lounge, which may be funny but
    isn't going to do much harm.</p>

    <p>You might be better off passing the time by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/matt_gibson">looking
    through my photos on Flickr</a>...</p>

    <p>Regards,<br/>Matt<p>
